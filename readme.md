# Dashboard App

Follows to some extent the MVC style architecture. The aim is to display data from a database as charts.

## Architecture
Basic structure is as follows:
* *Server.go* - Entry point to app and routing
* *Controllers*  - Provide handler functions and general page logic
* *Views* - Provides templates
* *Models* - Provides data for the controller and associated view

#### Server
Entry to the app on port :3000.
```cli
go run server.go
```

Routing is on a specific basis with a default route to index.
#### Controllers



#### Views


#### Models
